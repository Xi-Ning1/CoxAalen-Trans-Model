The purpose of the folder is to implement the ES-type algorithm for the proposed Cox-Aalen transformation with the logarithmic transformation G(x)=r^{-1}log(1+rx) for censored data. 


The folder contains three main R scripts designed to reproduce the simulation results presented in Section 3 of the main paper. The scripts are named as follows:

- `simulation1&2.R`: main script to run Scenarios 1 and 2 of the main paper.
- `simulation3.R`: main script to run Scenario 3 of the main paper.
- `simulation4.R`: main script to run Scenario 4 of the main paper.

To reproduce the simulation results, open any of the simulation files mentioned above and install the required R packages. Then, run the script in R.
